      "direct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which was later acquired by Oracle). He is often referred to as the 'Father of Java'. The other options are inventors of different programming languages: Guido van Rossum for Python, Dennis Ritchie for C, and Bjarne Stroustrup for C++.",
      "detailed_reasoning": "James Gosling initiated the Java project in June 1991 at Sun Microsystems. The language was originally called Oak after an oak tree outside Gosling's office, and then later renamed Java. His work laid the foundation for one of the most widely used programming languages today, known for its portability and 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' capability.",

      "formatted_question": "Which statement is true about Java?\n\na) Java is a sequence-dependent programming language\nb) Java is a code dependent programming language\nc) Java is a platform-dependent programming language\nd) Java is a platform-independent programming language",
      "direct_answer": "d",
      "explanation": "One of Java's core design principles is 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' (WORA). This means that compiled Java code (bytecode) can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent. This distinguishes it from many other languages that require recompilation for different operating systems or hardware.",
      "detailed_reasoning": "Java achieves platform independence through the use of Java bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When Java source code is compiled, it is converted into platform-neutral bytecode, not machine-specific native code. This bytecode can then be executed by any JVM, which acts as an interpreter and runtime environment for the bytecode on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.). This mechanism ensures that Java applications can run without modification on any system equipped with a compatible JVM.",

      "explanation": "The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and other tools. It contains everything needed to compile, debug, and execute Java programs.",
      "detailed_reasoning": "Let's analyze the options:\n-   <b>IDE (Integrated Development Environment):</b> While IDEs (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) are used to write, compile, debug, and execute Java programs, they are applications that bundle and integrate the underlying JDK tools, not the tools themselves.\n-   <b>JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler):</b> This is a component of the JVM that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime. It's for execution performance, not compilation/debugging setup.\n-   <b>JDK (Java Development Kit):</b> This is the comprehensive suite that provides all the tools necessary for Java development, including the compiler (javac) for compilation, debugging tools, and the JRE (which contains the JVM) for execution.\n-   <b>JVM (Java Virtual Machine):</b> The JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It's part of the JRE, which is part of the JDK. It only executes; it doesn't compile or provide debugging tools independently.",
