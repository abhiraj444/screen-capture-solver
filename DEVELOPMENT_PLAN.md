# AI Question Solver - Agentic Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the "AI Question Solver" Chrome extension. The goal is to create a robust and feature-rich extension using an agentic development approach. This plan is designed to be a living document, continuously updated by the development agent to reflect the current state of the project.

### 1.1. Core Vision

The core vision is to build a Chrome extension that can capture questions from any webpage, send them to an AI for solving, and display the results to the user in a clean and intuitive interface. The extension will also maintain a history of solved questions and provide user-centric features like analytics and export options.

### 1.2. Agentic Development Principles

This project will be developed following these principles:

*   **Modularity:** The codebase will be divided into small, well-defined modules with clear responsibilities. This will make it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the code.
*   **Detailed Commenting:** Every file will have a header comment explaining its purpose. Every function will be preceded by a comment explaining its functionality, parameters, and return value. Complex logic will be explained with inline comments.
*   **Living Documents:** The `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` and `USER_STORIES.md` files will be kept up-to-date to reflect the project's progress.
*   **Frequent Commits:** The development agent will make small, atomic commits to the Git repository, with clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   **Automated Testing:** (Future) Unit and integration tests will be written to ensure the correctness of the code.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1. Frontend (Chrome Extension)

*   **Manifest Version:** 3
*   **Core Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks:** None to start, to keep it lightweight. We will evaluate the need for libraries like React or Vue.js later.
*   **File Structure:**
    ```
    /extension
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── popup/
    │   ├── popup.html
    │   ├── popup.js
    │   └── popup.css
    ├── background/
    │   └── background.js
    ├── content/
    │   └── content.js
    ├── history/
    │   ├── history.html
    │   ├── history.js
    │   └── history.css
    ├── options/
    │   ├── options.html
    │   └── options.js
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── icons/
    │   └── styles/
    └── utils/
        ├── api.js
        └── helpers.js
    ```

### 2.2. Backend

*   **Platform:** Node.js with Express.js (initially, may be expanded)
*   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API
*   **Database:** Firebase (Firestore) for user data and history

## 3. Development Phases

The project will be developed in the following phases:

*   **Phase 1: Core Foundation:** Build the basic extension structure, including the popup, background script, and content script. Implement the screenshot capture functionality.
*   **Phase 2: AI Integration:** Integrate with the Gemini API to send screenshots and receive solutions.
*   **Phase 3: UI/UX:** Develop the user interface for displaying questions and answers, including the history page.
*   **Phase 4: Storage:** Implement local and Firebase storage for question history and user preferences.
*   **Phase 5: Advanced Features:** Implement features like batch processing, analytics, and export options.
*   **Phase 6: Polishing and Deployment:** Refine the UI/UX, perform thorough testing, and prepare for deployment to the Chrome Web Store.

## 4. Git Workflow

*   The `main` branch will be the primary branch.
*   Development will be done on feature branches, created from `main`.
*   Each commit will be small and atomic, representing a single logical change.
*   Commit messages will follow the Conventional Commits specification.
